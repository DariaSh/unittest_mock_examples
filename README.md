# unittest_mock_examples
This repo contains simple examples of unittest.mock package usage  which I used for illustrating a blog article.
Here you can find example of module bucket.py and my_module.py.
Modules test_bucket.py and test_my_module.py contain test for modules above, correspondingly.

# requirements.txt
For illustration of code using Google Cloud Bucket there is a need to install corresponding library. 
Please run
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt 

for install all libraries required.

# run test examples
Not all examples,mentioned in the blog article are available in the repo, but few the most essential ones.
To run tests you can simply type in commeand line 
$ python3 -m unittest test_*.py
